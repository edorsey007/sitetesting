                 You’re on our website. You’re looking at our “Careers” page. This is an opportunity we don’t want to waste. So let’s cut to the chase. We can sell you on LiveIntent with more words than Joyce needed for Ulysses but that’s not going to change your mind. It’s not going to move you from “researcher (nudge nudge wink wink)” to “candidate.” If you want to browse around a bit, feel free to take a look at some photos and some fluffy feel good language below. But there’s no substitute for a face-to-face conversation for the both of us. There’s no better way to realize whether or not LiveIntent is the right place for you. We’re always down for a chat if you are?

                This is a picture of people dressed up in costumes. it’s not at our office. It’s at one of the after party’s at one of our semi-annual all company offsites. We fly people from all of our offices around the world in to our HQ in NYC for an entire week. And sometimes (usually) we close out the week with a party that’s envy inspiring. And sometimes (often) we have ridiculous themes and dress up in support of them. This time was a luau at <a href="http://www.royalpalmsshuffle.com/">Royal Palms</a> If you want to be a part of this picture, join LiveIntent, start dating someone at LiveIntent, or “crush” photoshop and insert yourself.

            <p class="mb8">
              The only thing that’s going to convince you to share your resume with us is a belief in our story and <a href="/technology">our vision</a>, an appreciation and interest in what <a href="/about/press">we’ve accomplished</a>, followed by a visit to one of our offices to interview with some of our teams. Ideally, when that happens, you have an honest-to-goodness realization that what you want to do in your career maps perfectly well to what we’re trying to do as a company … and how we’re trying to do it. Because the how matters just as much than the what.
