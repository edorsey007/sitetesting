            <p class="mb8">
                 LiveIntent was born and brewed in downtown Manhattan in 2009. Since then, a lot has changed, but our core principles have stayed the same. We love email and shout it from the rooftops. We’re passionate about educating our clients, partners and employees so that they love email, too. We walk through walls to solve problems and work tirelessly to combat the misconception about “the death of email.”

            <p class="mb8">
                Beyond the Color Runs, the volleyball team, the cooking classes, the paint nights, and the Escape the Rooms, we look for the fun in solving problems. It’s all too easy for CPMs, ad serving, and discrepancies to get dull, so we truly try to bring fun to whatever we’re doing. Whether it’s a spontaneous costume party, a volunteering opportunity, or a friendly chat around the snack table at work, we help each other and share lots of laughs.

              We’re smart. We're unique. We’re fun to work with. And we’re looking for people that are smart, unique, and fun to work with. We’ve also been recognized by Forbes as one of the most promising companies, and by Crain’s as the 2nd fastest growing company in NY (for 2 years straight!). If this seems like a rocket ship you want to get on board, we’d love to hear from you.
