						<p>Be Present. What you see in-front of you are the hands of a beast jutting out from someone’s torso, and holding a phone. What does this have to do with “Be Present?” Everything.</p>
						<p>The idea originated when our CEO, Matt Keiser, was spending an afternoon with his kids. He realized that he was spending more time on his phone working than he was spending time interacting with his kids. A life-changing moment. He wasn’t himself when he had his phone out. It actually wasn’t him. It was the monster within. An alter ego. He was with his family but he wasn’t present. And he realized quickly that he needed to change. So he embraced that moment and created a reminder of the importance of being present.
						</p>
						<p>He created this shirt to remind everyone at LiveIntent to “Be Present”. The lesson had broader applications, which is why when you come to one of our offices you’ll see the motto and the logo reflected everywhere. In essence, “Be Present” has three layers.</p>
