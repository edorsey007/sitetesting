Getting Started 
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Ruby** — (including development headers, v1.9.3 or above for Jekyll 2 and v2 or above for Jekyll 3)
 - **Ruby Gems** 
 - **Linux, Unix, or Mac OSX**
 - **NodeJS** — or another JavaScript runtime (Jekyll 2 and earlier, for CoffeeScript support).
 - **Ruby Gems, version 1.9.3 or newer**

### Install Jekyll with RubyGems

1. Make sure you have Ruby Gems installed [ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).
2. The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems. At the terminal prompt, simply run the following command to install Jekyll:

```shell
# install Jekyll
$ gem install jekyll

```

**Installing Xcode Command-Line Tools**

If you run into issues installing Jekyll's dependencies which make use of native extensions and are using Mac OS X, you will need to install Xcode and the Command-Line Tools it ships with. Download in  Preferences → Downloads → Components.

### Basic Jekyll Usage

```shell
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site
$ jekyll build

```

```shell
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>
$ jekyll build --destination <destination>

```

```shell
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.
$ jekyll build --watch

```
### Running the server locally

```shell
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled. Use `--no-watch` to disable.

$ jekyll serve

```

```shell
# => Same as `jekyll serve` but will detach from the current terminal.
#    If you need to kill the server, you can `kill -9 1234` where "1234" is the PID.
#    If you cannot find the PID, then do, `ps aux | grep jekyll` and kill the instance. [Read more](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html).
$ jekyll serve --detach

```
### Directory Structure

[Jekyll Directory Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/). Each URL has a folder. For example: 

"/about" contains an index.html file which is linked to liveintent.com/about
"/about/press" contains a press.html file which is linked to liveintent.com/about/press
