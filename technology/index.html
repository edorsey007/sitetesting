              	<p>91% of consumers use it at least once a day (ExactTarget citation) and it’s 40x better at acquiring new customers than Facebook and Twitter (McKinsey citation.)</p>
              	<p>More people are spending more time online than ever before -- across all screens, devices, and browsers. In this new, cross-device world, email is more important than ever. While most digital media was lauding “real-time,” and “programmatic”, advertising within email seemed more like direct mail than digital marketing. Targeting was nonexistent, cookies were obsolete and optimization was scant. Advertisers paid for email ads on send. A publisher partner would hardcode the ad into an email template for each and every send. There was no transparency on what kind of delivery the advertiser would receive, nor reporting on how it performed.</p>
              	<p>LiveIntent knows that your email subscribers are your most valuable customers – they have opted-in and given you permission to message them. They expect and deserve only the best user experience possible. Our <span class="orange">LiveTag</span> is helping make that possible.</p>

              	<p>Everything on the LiveIntent Platform begins and ends with the LiveTag. This snippet of lightweight HTML code is compatible with all ESP’s and allows email senders to monetize their email newsletters and alerts. In doing so, it connects to our robust prediction engine, which enables advertisers to reach the exact target audience they’re looking for, in the best performing media channel. Most importantly, it enables 130MM people to get the right message, at the right time, on the right device. How’s that for the best of both the tech & data worlds?</p>
              	<p>Publishers and brands only need to add the LiveTag to their email templates once to monetize their email newsletters easily and effectively. Once a person opens an email newsletter that contains a LiveTag, LiveIntent’s servers detect a number of variables and chooses the best advertisement, marketing message, or content to show, in real-time. No more hard coding ads into every single newsletter send.</p>
              	<p>The limits of email - with hundreds of permutations of device, operating system, and browser - have yielded some interesting benefits. As a result of these complications, LiveTags are as lean as possible, no heavy javascript or invasive iframes, including only the code that is absolutely necessary to serve messages into email.</p>
